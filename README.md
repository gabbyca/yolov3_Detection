# yolov3_Detection

1. Clone repository in IDE
2. Download yolov3.weights and drag into workspace (sent in email)
3. Create a folder in workspace titled 'videoStorageOpencv'
4. Install requirements.txt
5. Open terminal and cd into file in which repo was cloned in
6. Once in the right path run $python3 main.py

These are the exact steps I take:
1. $cd Desktop 
2. $mkdir IA 
3. Open IDE and clone repo and select IA as location 
4. drag weights file into workspace 
5. create folder videoStorageOpencv 
6. open terminal 
7. $cd Desktop 
8. $cd IA 
9. $ls (should see repo name) 
10. $cd yoloV3_Detection 
11. $python3 main.py

The code is set to open a webcam on port 0 on macos (should be built in webcam). It may ask for permission the first time, so just run the code again.
